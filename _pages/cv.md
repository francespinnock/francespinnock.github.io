description: About Frances Pinnock
---
<br />

Frances Pinnock (b. 1990, Bristol UK) is a multidisciplinary artist living and working in London, UK. With a focus on sculpture, pattern cutting and hand stitching underpin the making of her works that pertain to the body. She utilises materials such as leather and collected objects; drawing references from art history, puppetry, historical clothing and literature.

From a background in puppet making Pinnock studied for a BA in Modelmaking at the Arts University Bournemouth and an MA in Sculpture at the Royal College of Art. She trained in hand sewn shoemaking and worked for ten years in bespoke accessories alongside her studio practice, developing the technical and material knowledge that plays into her work.
