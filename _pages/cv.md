Frances Pinnock (b. 1990, Bristol UK) is a London based artist. With a background in puppet making she studied for a BA in Modelmaking at the Arts University Bournemouth and an MA in Sculpture from the Royal College of Art. Following her BA Frances trained in hand sewn shoemaking and worked for ten years in bespoke accessories alongside her studio practice, developing the technical skills that play into her sculpture.
