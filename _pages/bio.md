<br/>  
Frances Pinnock (b. 1990 Bristol, UK) is a visual artist living and working in London. She holds an MA in sculpture from the Royal College of Art, London and works across mediums including sculpture, painting, drawing, and installation. Loosely diaristic, her works draw on a constellation of observations and affective states, and exist as abstract vignettes and noctuaries.  

Her solo exhibition _Accoutrements & Illuminations_ is currently showing with Sarah Myerscough Gallery, London until 29 November (2025) with an accompanying essay by artist and writer Sharon Kivland. In 2024 Pinnock received the Ingram Prize for her work _Light Sleeper_ and will present a solo exhibition of the same name at Lightbox Gallery & Museum, Woking, (2025). Recent group exhibitions include: _FOG Design+Art_, San Francisco (2022, 2025); _Ingram Prize_, Unit 1 Gallery | Workshop, London (2024); _This Country_, Crafts Council Gallery, London (2024); _TEFAF Maastricht_, Maastricht (2024); _Cut & Fold_, Make Hauser & Wirth, Somerset (2023); _Material Beings_, Cromwell Place, London (2023); _Hung, Drawn & Quartered_, Standpoint Gallery, London (2023). Pinnock's works are in the collections of The Ingram Collection and the Museum of Leathercraft.
