<hr />

I am a London-based artist working across sculpture and print making. I handwork elements from oak trees into inks and washed to produce print paintings that are a swift and gestural recording of pattern pieces.
 
Forms become panel pieces for three dimensional works realised in English oak bark tanned leather, meticulously and meditative stitched together by hand. I hand twist hemp yarn with beeswax for my threads.
 
My practice explores the effects time and environment play on natural materials, harmonising simple forms with oxidised and patinated surfaces. 
 
I work primarily with leather produced by the last remaining oak bark tannery in the UK. J & F J Baker utilise bovine skins as a byproduct of the Devon meat industry, and tanning processes that have remained unchanged for over a thousand years. As the sap rises in spring, Oak bark is gathered from coppiced woods in the Lake District, and each skin is left to mature for over a year before working into sculpture.
