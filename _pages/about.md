**The Art of the Exceptional | Fortnum & Mason x QEST**  
Fortnum & Mason, London  
9 - 29 MAY 2022

A Jubilee Celebration of Makers: Fortnum & Mason (F&M) and the Queen Elizabeth Scholarship Trust (QEST) have come together to produce an iconic one-off 'Jubilee Hamper', celebrating the best of British making. All profit from its sale will provide a new scholarship so that together F&M and QEST can continue to support and foster the makers of the future. A series of 5 exhibitions, from March to June, introduce and explore the project and celebrate the wealth of talent supported by QEST. 

Frances will be exhibiting as part of **Leather : Metal : Cloth**
