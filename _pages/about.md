description: About Frances Pinnock
---


<br /> 
Frances Pinnock is an artist living and working in London. Her practice is an exploration of junctures, understood both temporally and materially. She utilises collected objects and organic media – variously, leather, vellum, wax and hair – to create works that possess something of the uncanny in their materiality and configuration. Combining meticulous hand processing, gestural mark making and assemblage, her works layer influences from Surrealism, puppetry, dance, and garment making with narratives grounded in subjective experience. 

Central to Pinnock’s work are the processes of pattern cutting and hand stitching, enabling ideas to shift between two and three-dimensions. These formulaic and repetitive elements are juxtaposed by ones of gesture and intuition – as assembled components are playfully arranged and rearranged until they rest in a final composition. Through the making of her work Pinnock experiences points of tension and rest in movement, while the works themselves engender tensions between motion and stasis, body and object.

Frances Pinnock (b. 1990, Bristol) holds a BA in Modelmaking from the Arts University Bournemouth and an MA in Sculpture from the Royal College of Art. Her works have been exhibited internationally at fairs including TEFAF Maastricht, NL (2024) and FOG Design + Art, San Francisco, USA (2022). Recent group exhibitions include 'Cut and Fold', Make Hauser & Wirth, Somerset (2023), 'Material Beings', Cromwell Place, London (2023) and 'Hung, Drawn and Quartered', Standpoint Gallery, London (2023).
